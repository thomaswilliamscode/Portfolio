      <p>
        There was a time when I tried every shortcut. Uber. Truck driving. Even writing and YouTube. 
        I was searching for something that felt <em class="bold">right</em>, but deep down, I was avoiding hard work 
        because I was afraid I wasn’t enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        Funny thing is… I already knew what I loved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back in high school, I took a programming class. I even had a paying client. But after a rough 
        experience, I gave up. Still, that little spark never left me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Years later, when I finally got tired of cutting corners, I went back to coding. No shortcuts. 
        No excuses.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started with Python. Writing little games on Replit using borrowed Wi-Fi. Then I leveled up to 
        JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, and more. It was hard. I failed A lot. I learned without a 
        computer. I dropped out of a coding bootcamp. I rebuilt my confidence on Treehouse, YouTube, and 
        trial by fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, I earned my certificate from BloomTech, and I got a whole new sense of who I am.
      </p>

      <h2>🛠 Tools I Use (and Love)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> – my first language and future ML curiosity</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – my main weapon, hard-won and battle-tested</li>
        <li><strong>React + Redux</strong> – I love thinking in components and wrangling data</li>
        <li><strong>Express + SQLite3</strong> – backend tools that feel like puzzle pieces clicking into place</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🌱 What I'm Looking For</h2>
      <p>
        My dream role? Somewhere I can <strong>grow</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, and <strong>give back</strong>.  
        I’d love to work with a team that’s passionate, supportive, and open to new ideas. Bonus points 
        if it’s related to <strong>animals</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, or anything that genuinely 
        makes the world a little better.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t need micromanagement. I need trust, purpose, and a chance to shine.
      </p>
