- 🧰 **Skills Section** — tools and languages I’ve used

### 🚧 Future Plans

This version is a static portfolio, built quickly to give a clean snapshot of my work. In the future, I plan to:

- Rebuild this using **React + Tailwind + TypeScript**
- Add live filtering for projects
- Improve accessibility and responsive design
- Integrate blog-style updates and learning logs
